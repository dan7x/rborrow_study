A research project that involves scaping r/borrow for historical loans. 
One-time search (or possible sporadic future scrapes on an ad-hoc basis) 
to generate a dataset. 

Having such data may enable insights into borrowers' behavior on the subreddit, 
and perhaps enable novel quantitative lending strategies (e.g., testing hypotheses for 
probabalistically favorable lending terms).

As of June 2023, the (Pushshift API)[https://pushshift.io/] 
ceased to operate due to the Reddit API changes, so only a partial ingest (up to around 2019) 
was able to be completed.
